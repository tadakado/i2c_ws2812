# i2c_ws2812

I2C to WS2812 (RGB LED) converter

## MCU and Peripherals ###

The code is tested on ATtiny 0 & 1 series (ATtiny212 & ATtiny402).
I2C, CCL, SPI, and TCA peripherals are used.

## I2C ###

### Write RGB data

Each register for a LED has 3-byte data. You can send <LED #> <Green> <Red> <Blue> followed by the slave address (0x08).
Multiple LED data can be transfered without specifying the next LED.
That is, <LED 0> <Green 0> <Red 0> <Blue 0> <Green 1> <Red 2> <Blue 3> ... .
Data exceeding the limit of the memory will be omitted.
The maximum number of LEDs for ATtiny202/212 and ATtiny402/412 are 29 and 72, respectively.
The numbers will change in other MCUs or with code modifications.

### Send RGB data to WS2812

When writing the number of LEDs to the special register (0xff), the controller starts to send the data to WS2812.

### Registers

| Register | Reg0 | Reg1 | ... | Reg28 | Reg255 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Data | G0, R0, B0 | G1, R1, B1 | ... | G28, R28, B28 | Num_of_LEDs |

##  WS2812 (RGB LED) ###

The control signal for WS2812 is generated by CCL described in the reference.
